# Hatsune Miku Theme (Digital Diva Edition)

> "The World is My Stage, and Code is My Song."

A high-fidelity Visual Studio Code theme optimized for long-term professional use, deeply integrated with the aesthetics of **Hatsune Miku V4X**.

## 🎵 Design Philosophy: The Digital Diva

This is not just a color swap. This theme treats your IDE as a **Virtual Stage**, applying strict semantic mapping to transform code into a performance.

| Concept | Element | Color | Meaning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **The Identity** | **Hair / Tie** | **`#39C5BB` (Teal)** | **Keywords**. The core structure and logic that holds everything together. |
| **The Voice** | **Eyes** | **`#4DD0E1` (Cyan)** | **Functions**. The active, melodic part of the code that *does* things. |
| **The Rhythm** | **Ribbons / LEDs** | **`#E05096` (Magenta)** | **Constants & Numbers**. The precise, unchangeable beats that drive the logic. |
| **The Content** | **Negi (Leek)** | **`#9CCC65` (Green)** | **Strings**. The raw content and data being processed. |
| **The Stage** | **Outfit** | **`#1A1F24` (Charcoal)** | **UI Background**. A deep, non-distracting dark grey mimics her V4X uniform fabric. |
| **The Warning** | **"01" Tattoo** | **`#FF5370` (Red)** | **Errors & Regex**. High-visibility alerts and complex patterns. |

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Semantic Visual Hierarchy
-   **Keywords** are **Bold** to establish the skeleton of your code.
-   **Functions** are *Italicized* to distinguish action from data.
-   **Comments** are faded (`#455A64`) to filter out visual noise, letting you focus on the logic.

### 2. Global Immersion
-   **Workbench Integration**: The entire UI (Sidebars, Terminals, Inputs) matches Miku's V4X charcoal & gray outfit.
-   **Holographic UI**: Borders, selections, and focus states use transparent Teal/Pink overlays, mimicking digital hologram interfaces.
-   **Sound Wave Guides**: Indent guides use varying opacity to resemble digital sound waves.
-   **Structure Tracking**: Rainbow brackets (Pink -> Cyan -> Amber) help you track complex nested logic effortlessly.

### 3. Multi-Language Adaptability
-   **Markdown**: Distinct styling for Headings (Pink/Teal Bold) vs Content.
-   **CSS/SCSS**: Classes (Teal) and IDs (Pink) are instantly recognizable.
-   **JSON/Validation**: Structural keys are Teal, separating them clearly from string values.
